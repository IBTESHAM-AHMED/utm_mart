# Simplified Seller System Implementation

## Overview
The UTM Mart multi-vendor system has been simplified to use basic user information instead of complex business profiles. Any registered user can sell products using their personal details (name, email, phone, address), making it easier for buyers to identify and contact sellers.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified Seller Model**
- **Renamed**: `VendorModel` â†’ `SellerModel`
- **Removed**: Business-specific fields (business name, description, logo, categories, etc.)
- **Kept**: Essential user details for seller identification

```dart
class SellerModel {
  final String userId;        // User ID from auth
  final String userName;      // User's display name
  final String userEmail;     // User's email
  final String userPhone;     // User's phone
  final AddressModel userAddress;  // User's address
  final bool isActive;        // Can sell or not
  final double rating;        // Seller rating
  final int totalProducts;    // Statistics
  final int totalOrders;      // Statistics
  final double totalRevenue;  // Statistics
}
```

### 2. **Updated Product Model**
Products now store seller's personal information for buyer reference:

```dart
class ProductModel {
  final String vendorId;      // Seller's user ID
  final String? vendorName;   // Seller's name
  final String? vendorEmail;  // Seller's email  
  final String? vendorPhone;  // Seller's phone
  // ... other product fields
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Order Model**
Orders now include seller details so buyers can see who they're buying from:

```dart
class OrderModel {
  final String vendorId;      // Seller's user ID
  final String? vendorName;   // Seller's name for buyer reference
  final String? vendorEmail;  // Seller's email for buyer reference
  final String? vendorPhone;  // Seller's phone for buyer reference
  // ... other order fields
  
  // Helper methods for buyers
  String get sellerDisplayName;  // Returns seller's name
  String get sellerContactInfo;  // Returns "Email: ... â€¢ Phone: ..."
}
```

### 4. **Updated UI Components**

#### **Product Cards**
- Show "Sold by [Seller Name]" instead of business names
- Display user's personal name for seller identification

#### **Seller Dashboard**
- Renamed from "Vendor Dashboard" to "Seller Dashboard"
- Shows "Active Seller" status instead of "Active Vendor"
- Simplified profile completion requirements
